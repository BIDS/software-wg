Sprints
=======

Open source scientific software is a crucial element of scientific
discovery, yet relies mostly on the volunteer efforts of developers
scattered across the globe.  This makes it hard to build communities,
to rapidly conduct complex discussions, and to focus on specific
problems long enough to find optimal solutions.

Sprints are events at which developers get together (most often in the
same physical space) to collaborate a specific project or feature.  We
see sprints as one very effective way of addressing the above
concerns, since bringing together contributors strengthens social
bonds and allows for much higher bandwidth communications.
