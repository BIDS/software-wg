Present: Stéfan, Jarrod, Chris Hench, Elena Glassman, Chris Holdgraf, Dmitriy Morozov, Jonathan Dugan, Nathaniel Smith (phone), Carl B, Chris Kennedy


* [Stéfan] Introduction & overview of last years
* [Jarrod] DS4DS v2
   * Related to NumPy grant
   * Reading group (patterns, architecture, view from Berkeley paper?, grammar of graphics)
   * Paper after
   * Sub-ideas to clarify:
      * API
      * Exchange formats
      * Level/scope: just arrays? API patterns for common machine learning patterns? ...
* [Nathaniel] Numpy grant: make NumPy better
   * Job ad up in next week or two
   * Nathaniel giving talk on Thursday
   * Contributions include topics such as:
      * Refactor internal architecture to extend data representation
      * First class support for categorical data, missing data, sparse arrays, customizable data types
      * Lots of smaller issues to triage and prioritize
* [Chris Holdgraf & Nelle] Docathon
   * Week-long event to increase documentation
   * https://docathon.github.io/docathon/ 
   * Tooling work:
      * Numpydoc
      * Improvements to the website
      * Analytics pipeline for the github workflow
      * Visualizations for the analytics
* Data science Kaggle/other competition for team building
   * Intense 2-day hackathon, vs longer term low burner project
   * For team building, probably shorter term
   * Try to rope in folks who aren’t here every day
   * Jonathan++
   * Nelle mentions:
      * in their previous team they used to do this as a retreat event
      * It may be possible to publish a paper on this, if we pick the challenge carefully
* [Dmitriy] Vis Extravaganza
   * First event: tomorrow (Tue, 10/17/2017); then possibly monthly
   * Discussion on how to make paper figures better / more effective
   * Expand across campus?
   * Jarrod suggests contacting Deb Nolan for vis lecture
   * Organizational help welcome
* [Dmitriy] Dionysus
   * It computes persistent homologies
* [Stéfan] Machine Shop
* [Stéfan] SkyPortal
* [Jarrod] GraphXD
   * https://graphxd.github.io
   * Seminar series on theory of and computation on graphs
   * Workshop
   * Book?
* In general, connect with Marsha to communicate these types of events
* [Nelle] Peer code review of small snippets
   * Figure out technical problem, use better APIs, how to use library better, etc.
   * Impromptu?
   * Friday afternoon; drinks/food/happy code/happy hacks
   * Talk to Nelle about turning happy hours into part code-review
   * Connect with Stuart, Hacker Within?
* [Maryam] Education -- beyond Software Carpentry
   * Generate educational material, focused lessons, Software Carpentry++ bridging SWC to more advanced lectures
   * How do I package for pip, how do I share my data at UC Berkeley, etc.
   * Organize workshop to teach this type of thing at BIDS
   * J: Point blog post to technical work that has been done
   * Can we utilize existing materials from folks at UW, SciPy lectures
   * Take a look at what Data Carpentry has done already
* [Fernando] Software exercises collection
   * Stand-alone, not building on other work
   * Easy to select & re-use in lectures
* [Chris Hench]: Introductory data science notebooks
   * https://github.com/ds-modules
   * Course specific, mostly one per course, sometimes more, usually mid-semester for 1-4 class periods [DSEP + D-Lab + BIDS]
   * Social sciences, mainly
   * Blog post?
   * Watch for GitHub pages site


* [Chris Holdgraf] GitHub developer dashboard
   * The idea here is to use the GitHub API to create some kind of dashboard that developers can use to measure community health
   * There’s interest from some folks at GitHub in something like this, so we may be able to get a cool dataset from them.
   * [Stéfan]: Also take a look at OSS DevKit (currently under development at BIDS): https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Open-Source-DevKit-TB33O5Y8ZeTnTkHP1SbYN?_tk=share_copylink -- we already have a functional command line client that can be used to pull/push PR changes from/to GitHub.
* [Chris Holdgraf] Turtle JavaScript repo
   * Turtle is a great way for beginning programmers to learn about programming. Heavily-utilized in middle- and high-schools
   * Thomas Kluyver has a small javascript implementation of turtle: https://github.com/takluyver/mobilechelonian
   * It needs some marginal improvements to be a “full-fledged” turtle program. I think this would be a nice small-ish project to make improvements to.


Notes:


* S + J: write up above list and publish to https://bids.github.io/swg
* Update this website after each planning meeting


* Q: Is datascience.tables usable for real work?


* Does the BIDS blog have an Atom/RSS feed?
* Can we do a technical BIDS blog sub-feed?


* RopenSci: can we distill lessons learned?
